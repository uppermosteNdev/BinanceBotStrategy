# Treblle for .NET

  
  

Treblle makes it super easy to understand whatâ€™s going on with your APIs and the apps that use them. Just by adding Treblle to your API out of the box you get:

* Real-time API monitoring and logging

* Auto-generated API docs with OAS support

* API analytics

* Quality scoring

* One-click testing

* API managment on the go

* and more...

  

## Requirements

* .NET Framework 4.6.1

  

## Getting started

Create a FREE account on <https://treblle.com> to get an API key and Project ID.

  

You can install Treblle .NET via NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command:

```bash

Install-Package Treblle.Net

```

You will be prompted to enter your Treblle API key and Project ID. Your settings will be saved in ```Web.config``` and you can always edit them there.

Here is an example:

  

```xml

<configuration>
	<appSettings>
		<add  key="TreblleApiKey"  value="{Your_API_Key}"  />
		<add  key="TreblleProjectId"  value="{Your_Project_Id}"  />
	</appSettings>
</configuration>

```


Now you can specify which endpoints you want Treblle to track by adding this simple attribute to any API controller or method:

  

```csharp

[Treblle]

```

  

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project. Just by adding a few lines of code you get features like: auto-documentation, real-time request/response monitoring, error tracking and so much more.

  
  

### Need to hide additional fields?

If you want to expand the list of fields you want to hide, you can pass property names you want to hide by adding the ```AdditionalFieldsToMask``` property to your ```Web.config``` file like in the example below.

  

```xml

<configuration>
	<appSettings>
		<add  key="TreblleApiKey"  value="{Your_API_Key}"  />
		<add  key="TreblleProjectId"  value="{Your_Project_Id}"  />
		<add  key="AdditionalFieldsToMask"  value="secretField,highlySensitiveField"  />
	</appSettings>
</configuration>

```
